                                We're drawing closer to the event and the time has come to start tickets and registration! Ticket sales begin on <b>Monday January 13 at 9:00 AM</b>. Tickets can be bought from the <a target=0 href="/tickets.html">tickets page</a> or from our <a target=0 href="http://battleroyalelan.eventbrite.ca/">Eventbrite page</a>.

                                We are happy to announce that Battle Royale VII will be taking place on <strong>February 22nd to 23rd, 2014!</strong> This 24 hour LAN party will be held in the prestigious Tabaret Hall at the University of Ottawa.
                                <br><br>
                                As in past years, we aimed to hold the event at the beginning of November. However, after a series of unfortunate events, we were not able to book our usual venue. As a result, we broadened our search for other venues, and were excited to book Tabaret Hall in late February.
                                <br><br>
                                <strong>Ticket</strong> sales will begin in early <strong>January</strong>. The exact date will be announced as we draw closer to the event. We hope to see you all at<strong> Ottawa's Largest Gaming LAN Party!</strong> Follow us on

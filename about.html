                        <p > Battle Royale VII is Otawa's biggest LAN party involving various computer games and gaming console tournaments. <!--The competition last for a full 25-hours.--> The goal of Battle Royale is to bring together future engineers, computer scientists across the Ottawa Region to share their gaming passion in a relaxed environment. Hosted on the beautiful campus of Carleton University, this event has become an annual tradition for the university students in Ottawa studying not just Engineering and Computer Science, but other disciplines as well. Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from both the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and also Algonquin College. It has been a huge success over the past years, and this year we expect it to be even bigger and better. Battle Royale VII is going to be the best yet with an increased capacity and tournament quantity! We are also donating a protion of the profit made to the charity Child's Play, a game industry charity dedicated to improving the lives of children with toys and games worldwide.

Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from both the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and Algonquin College. It has been a huge success over the past six years.

                        At Battle Royale, you participate in LAN PC games by bringing your own PC or laptop. By buying a ticket you will be given desk space, power and an internet connection. For console games, we bring the televisions, consoles, and games. We greatly appreciate anyone who volunteers their consoles or games for the day as it helps us increase the amount of games we run, and the number of people who can play.

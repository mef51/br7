                    <h2>What is Battle Royale VII?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Battle Royale is a LAN party with games from both PC and console tournaments involving various computer games and gaming console tournaments. Battle Royale will last for a full 24-hours.The goal of the LAN party is to bring together engineering and computer science students across the Ottawa Region to share their passion for gaming in a relaxed environment. Battle Royale has become an annual tradition for all university and college students in Ottawa studying not just Engineering and Computer Science, but other disciplines as well. Battle Royale offers a unique opportunity to companies to expose themselves to over a hundred engineering and computer science students from both the University of Ottawa, Carleton University and Algonquin College. It has been a huge success over the past six years.

                    <p>
                        At Battle Royale, you participate in LAN PC games by bringing your own PC or laptop. By buying a ticket you will be given desk space, power and an internet connection. For console games, we bring the televisions, consoles, and games. We greatly appreciate anyone who volunteers their consoles or games for the day as it helps us increase the amount of games we run, and the number of people who can play.
